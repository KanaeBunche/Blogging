# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### For the Frontend

#### `npm start`

Runs the React app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the React app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### For the Backend

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have installed the necessary backend dependencies (e.g., Express, Mongoose) in your backend folder.

2. **Run the Backend**:
   You can use `nodemon` to run your backend server. In your backend directory, execute:
   ```bash
   nodemon app.js
